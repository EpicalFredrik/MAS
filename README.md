# MAS Maximo Application Suite Notes

I have installed the Maximo Application Suite (MAS) on an IBM Spectrum Fusion server to learn how to install, customize, upgrade and system administration of MAS.

I have followed the MAS Devops Collection when installing and this should be considered the official documentation when installing.
