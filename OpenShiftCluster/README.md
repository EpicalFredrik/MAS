# OpenShift Cluster

Iâ€™m not going to give any specifications; it varies depending on the setup. For example, we have cluster with 96 CPU, 375 GB memory and 1.7 TB disk for MAS, Manage, IOT, Monitor and Cognos.
Start the pod and setup the license files as we did above.
For MAS, we use the same parameters but remove the MongoDB_Replicas parameter.
